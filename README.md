Time Series Forecasting involves utilizing past historical data to predict future values at future time periods. There are many methods that can be used for forecasting, in statistical or machine learning models.
Since our data is affected by seasonality, where there are different outputs depending on specific periods of time, we will implement data pipelines which utilize models that address seasonality. For our statistical approach, we will be using VAR(Vector Model Regression) model for our multivariate data which will capture underlying patterns and trends, and for our machine learning approach we will be utilizing Facebook's PROPHET library,
which captures non-linear complex relationships within data and between features well as well as be able to handle missing values.
Our data are daily sales in Ecuardorian markets from Kaggle.
